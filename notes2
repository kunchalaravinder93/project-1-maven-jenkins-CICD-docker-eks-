Click Inbound Rules → Click New Rule (Right side panel).
Select Port → Click Next.
Choose TCP and enter 8080 in "Specific local ports".
Click Allow the connection → Click Next.

Open a command prompt as Administrator.
Navigate to Tomcat's bin/ folder:
cd C:\path\to\apache-tomcat\bin
service.bat install 
net start Tomcat9
(Replace Tomcat9 with your Tomcat version)
Now, Tomcat will start automatically on EC2 reboots.
